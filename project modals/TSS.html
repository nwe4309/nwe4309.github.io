            <h2>Development (Febuary 2021 - May 2022)</h2>
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            • The Shattering Swords is a third-person melee combat game in which you fight gem construct creatures that are attacking the village. As you progress through the village you gain access to three different swords that you can freely swap between to change your playstyle mid fight. At the center of the village is the boss which had been controlling the gem constructs. Defeat him to save the village and complete the game.
            <br>• The game was developed with a team of 5 developers and 6 artists, using scrum and agile methodologies. 
            <br>• My role in development was primarily the lead AI developer along with a fair amount of general programming tasks.
            <br>• Throughout the development of the game, I pitched many ideas and helped flesh out others ideas into what is in the finished game.
            <br>• My primary contribution to the project was creating the entire boss fight which included a behvaior tree AI with several different attack patterns that were triggered upon specific conditions during the fight.
