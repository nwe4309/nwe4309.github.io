            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>
                • 転Reincarnation生 is a 2D side scrolling shooter developed in Unity as part of the global game jam between RIT and KCG (Kyoto Computer Gakuin)
                <br>• The gameplay starts as a classic 2D side scrolling shooter as you blast the enemies in front of you as you travel right.
                <br>• Shooting costs health and the player will need a large amount of health to defeat the boss at the end of the level.
                <br>• Here in lies the twist, upon dying to the boss, the player will be sent back the other direction as a ghost.
                <br>• While traveling as a ghost, all enemies you killed while alive will be here and try to harm you. However, for each enemy you dodge, you gain a full heart of health.
                <br>• Upon traveling back to where you started, you can reincarnate at your body and start the level with your base health and all the health you gained as a ghost. Thus allowing you to have enough healh to defeat the boss once you complete your travel right.
                <br>• Developed in one week with a team of six members, three from RIT and three from KCG. I was one of the main programmers and created all the player and enemy actions and interactions such as moving, shooting, and spawning. As well, I created the boss' attack and the entire reincarnation process of traveling left to regain health.
                <br>• Because of the massive time zone diffence between RIT and KCG, we decided to split up the work based on location.
                <br>• The RIT members primarily focused on the development of the game with some UI and graphical changes while the KCG members primarily focused on creating art and music assets, as well as the overall game design of the game.
